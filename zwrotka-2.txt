Man, Google just told me there's 70 genders
I need the evidence, where's the defenders?
Maybe you're brain dead, you lost your receptors
They banned me, 'cause I'm a repeating offender
These are the stakes, in their race
I am not giving one inch to the gays
It's funny, the sin that God called this detestable
Now, when they claim it, they get all the praise
Evil
We only rockin' the blue and the pink
I think that you need to get a new shrink
Now, you're denyin' the science, ya dink
I want answers, right now, but you're tryin' to think
You were assigned one at birth
There's only two genders, man, look at the birds
Men should be straight, and women have curves
You just shakin' yo' fist up at God, you've got nerves
