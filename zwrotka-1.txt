Heh-ha, wait
They, them, his, hers
Zee, zim, wait, what are these words?
You are confused, why you talkin' in thirds?
You can only be one, it's not what you prefer
You're either one of the two
Whatever's between your two legs, is the proof
Whoever gave you the option to choose?
Man, just sit down and listen, I'm breakin' the news
It's only two genders, you're parents are jackin' you up
They might as well put some crack in your cup
You came out innocent, now you're corrupt
Now, you stand on the bridge, and you just wanna jump, heh
Got these pink-haired devils
Teachin' the kids in the school, they are vessels
Used by the enemy, he's just a rebel
Let's turn up the kettle
When God gets ahold of 'em, he won't be gentle
